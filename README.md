This is a bot is made with **[discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/)** and has a music system, an economy system, and a ticket system. I suggest you don't use this but you can only use it if you give credit. This is just a source code for a bot. Some of the bots that use this source code has more commands. 

# Commands

Here is the list of commands:

`!avatar` - Shows your avatar.
`!balance` - Shows your balance.
