This is a bot is made with **[discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/)** and that has a music system, an economy system, and a ticket system. I suggest you don't use this but you can only use it if you give credit. This is just a source code for a bot. Some of the bots that use this source code have more commands. Don't update this to V13 and once discord.js removes the V12 API, this will be archived.
